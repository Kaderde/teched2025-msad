# Get Hands-On Security Recommendations for Your SAP BTP Environment

## Description

This repository contains the material for the **Get Hands-On Security Recommendations for Your SAP BTP Environment** session.  

## Overview

In this session attendees will learn about the security recommendations for BTP services and how to implement them. The [SAP BTP Security Recommendations](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-security-recommendations-c8a9bb59fe624f0981efa0eff2497d7d/sap-btp-security-recommendations) are available in the SAP Help Portal in the sections for the SAP Business Technology Platform. These recommendations for the configuration of SAP BTP services help customers meet their compliance goals and secure their business.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are active trial accounts for SAP BTP and for the SAP Cloud Identity Services. 

**First you have to get your SAP BTP trial account. Follow these instructions:** 
[Get a Free Account on SAP BTP Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html)

**Then activate your SAP Cloud Identity Services trial. Follow the instructions in this blog:** 
[SAP Cloud Identity Services offered as Trial Version](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/13/sap-cloud-identity-services-offered-as-trial-version/)

ðŸ’¡You should have access to your mailbox, which you used while registering for your BTP trial account in order to activate your SAP Cloud Identity Services trial account.

**Finally, install a Time-based One-Time-Password (TOTP) authentication application (such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) on your mobile device and familiarize yourself with the process to create accounts in the app.**

Now you are ready to start the exercises.
