# Exercise 1 - Broken Access Control

## üìñ Overview :
Broken Access Control  is the most critical web application security risk, according to the [OWASP Top 10 2021 list (A01)](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/). It occurs when an application fails to enforce proper authorization, allowing users to access or modify resources they are not permitted to. When access control is broken, threat actors can act outside of their intended permissions. This can manifest in several ways:

- Horizontal Privilege Escalation.
- Vertical Privilege Escalation.
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).

## üîê CAP Security Concept: 

CAP provides a multi-layered security approach:

- Authentication: Verifies user identity (managed by XSUAA/IAS).

- Authorization: Controls what authenticated users can do:
    - Role-based (@requires annotations).
    - Instance-based (@restrict annotations).
    - Programmatic checks (in service handlers).
