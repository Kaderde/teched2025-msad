# Exercise 1.2 - Vertical Privilege Escalation

## üìñ  1. Overview :

After addressing [horizontal privilege escalation in Exercise 1.1](./ex1.1/README.md), the next step is to tackle vertical privilege escalation, which occurs when a user gains access to higher-privileged functions they shouldn't have. 
In our Incident Management system, this means a support user could perform actions that are reserved for administrators, such as closing high-urgency incidents, modifying closed incidents, or deleting incidents. 
This violates critical business rules and poses significant risks to the integrity and compliance of the system.

**Business Rules:**

* Support Users:
  - ‚úÖ Can view and create incidents.
  - ‚úÖ Can update or delete non-closed incidents assigned to them or unassigned.
  - ‚ùå Cannot close high-urgency incidents.

* Administrators:
  - ‚úÖ Can view, create, update, and delete all incidents.
  - ‚úÖ Can close all incidents, including high-urgency incidents.
  - ‚úÖ Can modify or delete closed incidents.

### Why This Matters

* **Business Impact:** Unauthorized closures could lead to critical incidents being ignored or improperly resolved.
* **Compliance Risk:** Violates the OWASP Top 10 A01 and the principle of least privilege, a fundamental security concept
* **Security Risk:** Support users could close critical incidents, modify closed ones, or delete evidence without approval.

### Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to identify and remediate vulnerabilities that allow support users to perform actions reserved for administrators. By enforcing strict access controls, we will ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations, thereby reinforcing business logic and mitigating security risks.

## üö® 2. Vulnerable Code :
we will use exactly the [remediated code from Exercise‚ÄØ1.1.](./ex1.1#%EF%B8%8F-4-remediation), It correctly prevents support users from touching other users‚Äô incidents, but it does not yet enforce admin‚Äëonly rules (e.g. closing high‚Äëurgency incidents, modifying closed incidents, deleting any incident).

**File**: `srv/services.cds`
```cds
using { sap.capire.incidents as my } from '../db/schema';

service ProcessorService {
  @restrict: [
    { grant: ['READ', 'CREATE'], to: 'support' },        // ‚úÖ Support can view all incidents
    { grant: ['UPDATE', 'DELETE'],                       // ‚úÖ UPDATE, DELETE granted to support users
      to: 'support',
      where: 'assignedTo is null or assignedTo = $user'  // ‚úÖ Horizontal control (correct)
    }
  ]
  entity Incidents as projection on my.Incidents;
}

annotate ProcessorService with @(requires: 'support');  // ‚ùå Only support role required, Admins excluded

```
**File**: `srv/services.js`
```
const cds = require('@sap/cds')

class ProcessorService extends cds.ApplicationService {
  init() {

... // Other methods...

// ‚ùå VULNERABILITY:
// No check for admin role and for high-urgency incidents when status is changed to 'closed'
// No check that only admins can modify closed incidents.
// No updates or deletes on closed incidents.
  async onModify(req) {
    const result = await SELECT.one.from(req.subject)
      .columns('status_code')
      .where({ ID: req.data.ID })

    if (!result) return req.reject(404, `Incident ${req.data.ID} not found`)

    if (result.status_code === 'C') {
      const action = req.event === 'UPDATE' ? 'modify' : 'delete'
      return req.reject(403, `Cannot ${action} a closed incident`)
    }
  }
  
}

... // Other methods

```

**Why This is Vulnerable:**
  - ‚ùå No DELETE validation in JavaScript to enforce admin-only deletion.
  - ‚ùå No check for incident urgency when a support user tries to close an incident.
  - ‚ùå Admin privileges are not enforced at both service (ProcessorService) and CRUD operation level.
    
## üí• 3. Exploitation: (TBD with screenshots)

### Step 1: Login as Alice (Support User) :
- Access SAP Build Work Zone.
- Login with alice.support@company.com. This user is set up from the from the previous exercise.
- Navigate to Incident Management application.

### Step 2: Exploit Closing High-Urgency Incident
- Action: 
  - Find a high-urgency incident assigned to Alice (e.g., "Strange noise when switching off Inverter").
  - Click "Edit" ‚Üí Change Status to "Closed".
  - Add a conversation message: "Closing this high-urgency incident as support user"
  - Click "Save"
- Result:
  - ‚ùå The system allows Alice to close High-Urgency incident, violating the business rule.

### Step 3: Login as Admin User

- Action:
  - Log out and log in as david.admin@company.com (admin role).
  - Navigate to the closed incident modified by Alice.
  - Attempt to edit the closed incident (e.g., add a comment).
- Result:
  - ‚ùå UI displays a blank loading screen (no error message).
  - ‚ùå Root Cause: @requires: 'support' in services.cds blocks admin access to the service.

### üìåCritical Vulnerability Summary
- ‚ùå Support users can close high-urgency incidents.
- ‚ùå Admins are excluded entirely from modifying closed incidents due to misconfigured @requires.
- ‚ùå No validation in services.js for:
  - Admin role when closing high-urgency incidents.
  - Admin role when modifying closed incidents.
- ‚ùå Silent errors for admins reduce transparency and hinder operations.

## üõ°Ô∏è 4. Remediation:
The fixes follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring support users are blocked from unauthorized actions while admins retain elevated permissions.

### Key Remediation Steps

* **Enhance Service-Level and Entity-Level Authorization:** Update services.cds to include explicit grants for admins and ensure proper role requirements.
* **Implement Custom Validation Logic:** Add checks in services.js to validate urgency and user roles during UPDATE operations, rejecting invalid closures.
* **Improve UI Error Handling:** Modify the frontend to display meaningful error messages for forbidden actions.

### Step 1: Update Services.cds
The updated version for this exercise introduces vertical privilege escalation protections, explicitly defining admin privileges for Processorservice while maintaining the horizontal controls from [Exercise 1.1]((./ex1.1/README.md))


```
// Updated srv/services.cds

using { sap.capire.incidents as my } from '../db/schema';

service ProcessorService {
  @restrict: [
    { grant: ['READ', 'CREATE'], to: 'support' },  // Support can view and create
    { grant: ['UPDATE', 'DELETE'], 
      to: 'support',
      where: 'assignedTo is null or assignedTo = $user'  // Horizontal control for support
    },
    { grant: '*', to: 'admin' }  // ‚úÖ NEW: Explicit full access for admins (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
  ]
  entity Incidents as projection on my.Incidents;

}

annotate ProcessorService with @(requires: ['support', 'admin']);  // ‚úÖ NEW: Allow both roles support and admin at service level.

...

```
Copy the complete code from this link: [services.cds](./services.cds).

Key Changes:

* ‚úÖ Admin Full Access: { grant: '*', to: 'admin' } grants admins complete CRUD permissions.
* ‚úÖ Service-Level Role Requirements: @requires: ['support', 'admin'] allows both roles to access the service.

### Step 2: Update Services.js
The initial remediation code from [Exercise 1.1]((./ex1.1/README.md)) secured against horizontal privilege escalation (support users interfering with others' incidents). 
However, it still allowed support users to perform actions reserved for administrators, such as closing high-urgency incidents. We enhance the existing services.js to fix vertical privilege escalation.

Here is the updated services.js with added checks to enforce the admin-only rules:

```
// Updated srv/services.js

... // Other methods

 // ‚úÖ NEW : Enforce admin-only operations (vertical ESC)
  async onModify(req) {
    // Fetch current incident state (status + urgency)
    const result = await SELECT.one.from(req.subject)
      .columns('status_code', 'urgency_code')
      .where({ ID: req.data.ID });

    if (!result) return req.reject(404, `Incident ${req.data.ID} not found`);

    // Check if incident is already closed
    if (result.status_code === 'C') {
    // ‚úÖ NEW : Allow only admins to modify/delete closed incidents
      if (!req.user.isAdmin()) {
        const action = req.event === 'UPDATE' ? 'modify' : 'delete';
        return req.reject(403, `Cannot ${action} a closed incident`);
      }
      // Admins can proceed
      return;
    }
    // ‚úÖ UPDATE : Check if user is attempting to close the incident (status_code set to 'C')
    if (req.data.status_code === 'C') {
    // ‚úÖ NEW : Block support users from closing high-urgency incidents
      if (result.urgency_code === 'H' && !req.user.isAdmin()) {
        return req.reject(403, 'Only administrators can close high-urgency incidents');
      }
    }

... // Other methods

module.exports = { ProcessorService }

```
Copy the complete code from this link: [services.js]([./services.js).

Key Changes:

* ‚úÖ Implements role-based access control using req.user.isAdmin().
* ‚úÖ Allows administrators to modify/delete closed incidents.
* ‚úÖ Returns 403 Forbidden with descriptive error message
* ‚úÖ Prevents support users from closing high-urgency incidents (urgency_code === 'H').
* ‚úÖ Allows administrators to close any incident, including high-urgency ones.

### ‚úÖ 5. Verification:
This section outlines the steps to confirm that the remediation for the Vertical Privilege Escalation vulnerability has been successfully implemented. The goal is to verify that:

* Support users cannot perform admin-only operations (e.g., closing high-urgency incidents, modifying/deleting closed incidents).
* Admin users can perform all operations, including those restricted for support users.

### Step 1: Deploy the Updated Application

```
mbt build
cf deploy mta_archives/incident-management_1.0.0.mtar
```
üí° Ensure the deployment includes both updated srv/services.cds and services.js logic.

### Step 2: Login as Alice (Support User)
- Action:
  - Access SAP Build Work Zone and log in with alice.support@company.com.
  - Locate a high-urgency incident (e.g., "URGENT: Inverter overheating" with urgency_code = 'H' and status_code = 'N').
  - Confirm the urgency is set to "High" and the status is "New" (not closed).
  - Click "Edit" and try to set the status to "Closed" (status_code = 'C').
  - Save the changes.
- Result:
‚ùå The system blocks the action.
‚ùå The UI displays an error: "Only administrators can close high-urgency incidents."
‚úÖ This confirms that vertical privilege escalation is prevented for high-urgency incidents.

* Click "Edit" and try to set the status to "Closed" (status_code = 'C').
* Save the changes.
### Step 3: Verify Alice Can Modify Her Own Incident
1. In the incident list, locate an incident assigned to **Alice**  *(e.g., "Strange noise when switching off Inverter")*
2. Verify the UI shows the assignment: The **Assigned To** column should display `alice.support@company.com`.
3. Click on the incident to open its details page.
4. Click the **Edit** button.
5. Attempt to modify the incident:
   1. Change the title to **"UPDATED BY ALICE - Test"**
   2. Add a conversation entry: `"Alice updated this incident"`
   3. Click **Save**

6. ‚úÖ **Expected Result:** The incident is now in edit mode. Alice can successfully change fields such as the title, status, or add a conversation message. This confirms that the **@restrict** rule **assignedTo = $user** evaluates to true for Alice's assigned incidents.

### Step 4: Verify Alice Cannot Modify Another User's Incident
Now, we will try to perform the original attack.
1. Return to the incident list.
2. Locate an incident that is explicitly assigned to Bob, for example, "No current on a sunny day".
3. Click on this incident to view its details.
4. Click the **Edit** button.
6. ‚ùå Expected Result: The application should prevent Alice from editing this incident. clicking Edit mode will trigger an authorization error message (e.g., "Error - Forbidden"). This confirms that the **where: 'assignedTo is null or assignedTo = $user'** clause is correctly blocking Alice's unauthorized modification attempts on incidents assigned to Bob.

> **Note:**  
> If you run into a generic **"Forbidden"** error message, you can replace it with a more descriptive message by handling the error in your `services.js` file.  
> Since the `@restrict` annotation does not support custom messages by default, you‚Äôll need to implement your own logic to provide clearer, user-friendly feedback to the end user.

## Summary

In these exercises, you have learned how:

* To address Horizontal Privilege Escalation by implementing **crucial data ownership field (assignedTo)** and enforcing granular authorization rules.
* To leverage CAP's native **@restrict annotation and the $user context** to declaratively define and enforce security policies directly within the service definition.
* To secure the application by ensuring support users can **only modify incidents assigned to them**, thereby reinforcing business logic and mitigating a critical OWASP Top 10 vulnerability.
