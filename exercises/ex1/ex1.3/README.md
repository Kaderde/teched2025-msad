# Exercise 1.3 - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Vulnerability: Unauthorized Access to Credit Card Data via IDOR

## üìñ  1. Overview :

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application exposes internal object references (e.g., customer IDs) without proper access controls, allowing attackers to manipulate these references to access unauthorized data. In our Incident Management system, we demonstrate how a support user can exploit IDOR to access credit card numbers stored in the Customers entity.

**Business Rules:**

* Support Users:
  - ‚úÖ Can view customer data.
  - ‚ùå Cannot access customers sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers).

* Administrators:
  - ‚úÖ Can view all customer data.

### Why This Matters

* **Business Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) could lead to data breaches, financial fraud, and loss of customer trust.
* **Compliance Risk:** Violates [PCI-DSS requirements](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/) for protecting payment card information and the principle of least privilege.
* **Security Risk:** Support users can manipulate customer IDs in the UI/API to access restricted data.

### Objective:

The objective of this exercise is to implement object-level authorization, data masking, and audit logging to ensure users only access customer data they are authorized to view. By enforcing these security controls, we will restrict data visibility appropriately and maintain comprehensive records of access, thereby protecting sensitive information and mitigating unauthorized data exposure risks.

## üö® 2. Vulnerable Code :
we will use exactly the [remediated code from Exercise‚ÄØ1.1.](../ex1.1#%EF%B8%8F-4-remediation), It correctly prevents support users from touching other users‚Äô incidents, but it does not yet enforce admin‚Äëonly rules (e.g. closing high‚Äëurgency incidents, modifying closed incidents, deleting any incident).

**File**: `db/schema.cds`
```
entity Customers : managed { 
  key ID        : String;
  firstName     : String;
  lastName      : String;
  name          : String = firstName ||' '|| lastName;
  email         : EMailAddress;
  phone         : PhoneNumber;
  incidents     : Association to many Incidents on incidents.customer = $self;
  creditCardNo  : String(16) @assert.format: '^[1-9]\d{15}$';  // ‚ùå No access control or masking
  addresses     : Composition of many Addresses on addresses.customer = $self;
}

```

**File**: `srv/services.cds`
```
using { sap.capire.incidents as my } from '../db/schema';

service ProcessorService {
  @restrict: [
    { grant: ['READ', 'CREATE'], to: 'support' },  // Support can view and create
    { grant: ['UPDATE', 'DELETE'], 
      to: 'support',
      where: 'assignedTo is null or assignedTo = $user'  // Horizontal control for support
    },
    { grant: '*', to: 'admin' }  // Admin full access
  ]
  entity Incidents as projection on my.Incidents;

}

annotate ProcessorService with @(requires: ['support', 'admin']); 

service AdminService {
  entity Customers as projection on my.Customers;
  entity Incidents as projection on my.Incidents;
}
annotate AdminService with @(requires: 'admin');

```

**File**: `srv/services.js`

```
const cds = require('@sap/cds')

class ProcessorService extends cds.ApplicationService {
  init() {

    // ‚úÖ Vertical privilege escalation fixed from Exercise 1.2
    this.before(['UPDATE', 'DELETE'], 'Incidents', this.onModify)
    
    return super.init()
  }

  // ‚ùå VULNERABILITY: Limited validation and no comprehensive IDOR protection
  async onModify(req) {
    // Fetch current incident state (status + urgency)
    const result = await SELECT.one.from(req.subject)
      .columns('status_code', 'urgency_code')
      .where({ ID: req.data.ID });

    if (!result) return req.reject(404, `Incident ${req.data.ID} not found`);

    // Check if incident is already closed
    if (result.status_code === 'C') {
      if (!req.user.isAdmin()) {
        const action = req.event === 'UPDATE' ? 'modify' : 'delete';
        return req.reject(403, `Cannot ${action} a closed incident`);
      }
      return;
    }
    
    // Check if user is attempting to close the incident
    if (req.data.status_code === 'C') {
      if (result.urgency_code === 'H' && !req.user.isAdmin()) {
        return req.reject(403, 'Only administrators can close high-urgency incidents');
      }
    }

    // ‚ùå VULNERABILITY 1: Information Disclosure in Error Messages
    // Error messages reveal incident existence and properties to unauthorized users.
    
    // ‚ùå VULNERABILITY 2: No Audit Trail
    // No logging of access attempts, making security monitoring impossible
    
    // ‚ùå VULNERABILITY 1: No Audit Logging

    // ‚ùå VULNERABILITY 1: No API-Level READ Validation
    // Users can directly access API endpoints to read any incident data
    
    // ‚ùå VULNERABILITY 2: No Comprehensive Audit Logging
    // No audit trail for API access, making IDOR attacks invisible

**File**: `package.json`

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@sap/cds": "^7",
    "@sap/cds-hana": "^2"
    // ‚ùå MISSING: "@cap-js/audit-logging"- Required for IDOR detection

    requires:
   //   ‚ùå MISSING: audit-log

resources:
  // ‚ùå MISSING: audit-log
  # Add this resource
  
```

**Why This is Vulnerable:**

- ‚ùå **No object-level validation:** A support user can manipulate customers IDs in the API to access other customer's data, including credit card numbers.- 
- ‚ùå **No data classification:** Credit card numbers are not annotated as sensitive, so audit logging isn't triggered.
- ‚ùå **No data masking:** Credit card numbers are displayed in full to all users.
- ‚ùå **No error messages that prevent information disclosure :**  (e.g., "Incident 12345 not found" reveals incident existence).
- ‚ùå **No audit logging:** No tracking of access to sensitive data or unauthorized access attempts, making it difficult to detect IDOR attacks.
- ‚ùå **Missing SAP Audit Log Service:** No integration with enterprise audit logging infrastructure required for compliance and security monitoring.
- ‚ùå **Compliance Gap:** Lacks detailed audit records required by regulations like GDPR, SOX, and industry standards.
     
## üí• 3. Exploitation: (TBD with screenshots)

### Step 1: Login as Alice (Support User) :
- Access SAP Build Work Zone.
- Login with alice.support@company.com. This user is set up from the from the previous exercise.
- Navigate to Incident Management application.

### Step 2: Exploit Closing High-Urgency Incident
- Action: 
  - Find a high-urgency incident assigned to Alice (e.g., "Strange noise when switching off Inverter").
  - Click "Edit" ‚Üí Change Status to "Closed".
  - Add a conversation message: "Closing this high-urgency incident as support user"
  - Click "Save"
- Result:
  - ‚ùå The system allows Alice to close High-Urgency incident, violating the business rule.

### Step 3: Login as Admin User

- Action:
  - Log out and log in as david.admin@company.com (admin role).
  - Navigate to the closed incident modified by Alice.
  - Attempt to edit the closed incident (e.g., add a comment).
- Result:
  - ‚ùå UI displays a blank loading screen (no error message).
  - ‚ùå Root Cause: @requires: 'support' in services.cds blocks admin access to the service.

### üìåCritical Vulnerability Summary
- ‚ùå Support users can close high-urgency incidents.
- ‚ùå Admins are excluded entirely from modifying closed incidents due to misconfigured @requires.
- ‚ùå No validation in services.js for:
  - Admin role when closing high-urgency incidents.
  - Admin role when modifying closed incidents.
- ‚ùå Silent errors for admins reduce transparency and hinder operations.

## üõ°Ô∏è 4. Remediation:
The fixes follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring support users are blocked from unauthorized actions while admins retain elevated permissions.

### Key Remediation Steps

* **Enhance Service-Level and Entity-Level Authorization:** Update services.cds to include explicit grants for admins and ensure proper role requirements.
* **Implement Custom Validation Logic:** Add checks in services.js to validate urgency and user roles during UPDATE operations, rejecting invalid closures.
* **Improve UI Error Handling:** Modify the frontend to display meaningful error messages for forbidden actions.

### Step 1: Update Services.cds
The updated version for this exercise introduces vertical privilege escalation protections, explicitly defining admin privileges for Processorservice while maintaining the horizontal controls from [Exercise 1.1]((../ex1.1/README.md))


```
// Updated srv/services.cds

using { sap.capire.incidents as my } from '../db/schema';

service ProcessorService {
  @restrict: [
    { grant: ['READ', 'CREATE'], to: 'support' },  // Support can view and create
    { grant: ['UPDATE', 'DELETE'], 
      to: 'support',
      where: 'assignedTo is null or assignedTo = $user'  // Horizontal control for support
    },
    { grant: '*', to: 'admin' }  // ‚úÖ NEW: Explicit full access for admins (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
  ]
  entity Incidents as projection on my.Incidents;

}

annotate ProcessorService with @(requires: ['support', 'admin']);  // ‚úÖ NEW: Allow both roles support and admin at service level.

...

```
Copy the complete code from this link: [services.cds](./services.cds).

Key Changes:

* ‚úÖ Admin Full Access: { grant: '*', to: 'admin' } grants admins complete CRUD permissions.
* ‚úÖ Service-Level Role Requirements: @requires: ['support', 'admin'] allows both roles to access the service.

### Step 2: Update Services.js
The initial remediation code from [Exercise 1.1]((../ex1.1/README.md)) secured against horizontal privilege escalation (support users interfering with others' incidents). 
However, it still allowed support users to perform actions reserved for administrators, such as closing high-urgency incidents. We enhance the existing services.js to fix vertical privilege escalation.

Here is the updated services.js with added checks to enforce the admin-only rules:

```
// Updated srv/services.js

... // Other methods

 // ‚úÖ NEW : Enforce admin-only operations (vertical ESC)
  async onModify(req) {
    // Fetch current incident state (status + urgency)
    const result = await SELECT.one.from(req.subject)
      .columns('status_code', 'urgency_code')
      .where({ ID: req.data.ID });

    if (!result) return req.reject(404, `Incident ${req.data.ID} not found`);

    // Check if incident is already closed
    if (result.status_code === 'C') {
    // ‚úÖ NEW : Allow only admins to modify/delete closed incidents
      if (!req.user.isAdmin()) {
        const action = req.event === 'UPDATE' ? 'modify' : 'delete';
        return req.reject(403, `Cannot ${action} a closed incident`);
      }
      // Admins can proceed
      return;
    }
    // ‚úÖ UPDATE : Check if user is attempting to close the incident (status_code set to 'C')
    if (req.data.status_code === 'C') {
    // ‚úÖ NEW : Block support users from closing high-urgency incidents
      if (result.urgency_code === 'H' && !req.user.isAdmin()) {
        return req.reject(403, 'Only administrators can close high-urgency incidents');
      }
    }

... // Other methods

module.exports = { ProcessorService }

```
Copy the complete code from this link: [services.js](./services.js).

Key Changes:

* ‚úÖ Implements role-based access control using req.user.isAdmin().
* ‚úÖ Allows administrators to modify/delete closed incidents.
* ‚úÖ Returns 403 Forbidden with descriptive error message
* ‚úÖ Prevents support users from closing high-urgency incidents (urgency_code === 'H').
* ‚úÖ Allows administrators to close any incident, including high-urgency ones.

### ‚úÖ 5. Verification:
This section outlines the steps to confirm that the remediation for the Vertical Privilege Escalation vulnerability has been successfully implemented. The goal is to verify that:

* Support users cannot perform admin-only operations (e.g., closing high-urgency incidents, modifying/deleting closed incidents).
* Admin users can perform all operations, including those restricted for support users.

### Step 1: Deploy the Updated Application

```
mbt build
cf deploy mta_archives/incident-management_1.0.0.mtar
```
üí° Ensure the deployment includes both updated srv/services.cds and services.js logic.

### Step 2: Login as Alice (Support User)
- Action:
  - Access SAP Build Work Zone and log in with alice.support@company.com.
  - Locate a high-urgency incident assigned to Alice or unassigned.
  - Confirm the urgency is set to "High" and the status is "New" (not closed).
  - Click "Edit" and try to set the status to "Closed" (status_code = 'C').
  - Save the changes.
- Result:
  - ‚ùå The system blocks the action.
  - ‚ùå The UI displays an error: "Only administrators can close high-urgency incidents."
  - ‚úÖ This confirms that vertical privilege escalation is prevented for high-urgency incidents.

### Step 3: Verify Alice Can Modify Non-High-Urgency Incidents
- Action:
  - Locate a medium-urgency (code: 'M') incident assigned to Alice or unassigned.
  - Click "Edit", change status to "Closed", and save.
- Result:
  - ‚úÖ The system allows the update and closes the incident.
  - ‚úÖ This confirms that normal workflow operations are preserved for non-critical incidents. Support users can close regular tickets ‚Äî only high-urgency closures are restricted.
 
### Step 4: Login as David (Admin User)
  - Action:
    - Log in with david.admin@company.com
    - Locate a high-urgency open incident (assigned to anyone or unassigned).
    - Click "Edit", change status to "Closed", and save.
- Result:
    - ‚úÖ The system successfully closes the high-urgency incident.
    - ‚úÖ This confirms that only administrators can perform sensitive actions like closing high-risk incidents, as enforced by { grant: '*', to: 'admin' } and correct role-based access control.
 
### Step 5: Verify David can Modify/Delete a Closed Incident
- Action:
  - Locate the closed incident from Step 4.
  - Edit the title or delete the incident.
- Result:
- ‚úÖ The system allows both operations.
- ‚úÖ This confirms admins bypass restrictions applied to support users.

### üìå Verification Summary:

The remediation successfully addresses Vertical Privilege Escalation by:

**1. Restricting Support Users:**

  - Cannot close high-urgency incidents.
  - Cannot modify/delete closed incidents.
  - Retain modify only to their own non-high-urgency incidents.

**2. Empowering Admin Users:**
  - Full access to all incidents and operations.
  - Can close high-urgency incidents and modify closed incidents.

**3. Security Mechanisms:**
  - Declarative Security: @restrict rules in services.cds enforce role-based access.
  - Imperative Security: services.js handlers (e.g., onModify) validate business rules.
  - Defense in Depth: Combined CDS annotations and JavaScript logic prevent bypasses.

## üìå Summary:

In these exercises, you have learned how to:
  - Mitigate Vertical Privilege Escalation by explicitly defining admin-only operations in @restrict rules.
  - Leverage CAP‚Äôs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to separate support and admin capabilities.
  - Combine Declarative and Imperative Security for comprehensive protection:
    * CDS Annotations (@restrict) for coarse-grained access control.
    * JavaScript Handlers (e.g., onModify) for fine-grained business logic enforcement.
  - Test Security Rules by validating both allowed and denied operations for each role.
